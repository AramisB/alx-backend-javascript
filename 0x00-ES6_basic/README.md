Welcome to ES6!
This README provides a quick introduction to ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), a significant update to JavaScript that introduced many powerful features to make your code more concise, readable, and maintainable.

What is ES6?

ES6 is the sixth major version of the ECMAScript language specification, the standard upon which JavaScript is built. Released in 2015, it brought a wave of new features and improvements to the language.

New Features in ES6

Here's a glimpse of some exciting additions in ES6:

const and let keywords: These replace the traditional var keyword for variable declaration. const creates constants (unchangeable values), and let creates block-scoped variables.
Arrow functions: A concise way to write functions, often used for short expressions.
Template literals: Make string creation more flexible with embedded expressions.
Enhanced object literals: Shorter syntax for defining object properties and methods.
Destructuring assignment: Extract values from arrays or objects in a more readable way.
Rest and spread syntax: Handle variable numbers of arguments in functions and copy object/array properties.
Classes: A more structured approach to object creation, similar to other object-oriented languages.
Iterators and for-of loops: Efficiently iterate through data structures like arrays.
Promises: Asynchronous programming made easier for handling non-blocking operations.
Modules: A powerful way to organize and import code across different files.
Constants vs. Variables

const creates a constant variable whose value cannot be changed after initialization. This improves code clarity and prevents accidental reassignments.
let declares a variable with block-scope, meaning it's only accessible within the code block (like an if statement or loop) where it's declared. Unlike var, let avoids variable hoisting, making code more predictable.
Block-Scoped Variables

Using let creates variables that are only accessible within the code block where they are declared. This helps prevent naming conflicts and keeps your code more organized.

Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a cleaner syntax for writing functions, especially when dealing with short expressions. They often don't need the function keyword and have implicit return for single-line expressions.

Default Function Parameters

Parameters in functions can now have default values assigned. This avoids the need for checking undefined arguments and provides cleaner code.

Rest and Spread Parameters

Rest: Captures an indefinite number of arguments as an array within a function.
Spread: Expands an iterable (like an array or string) into individual elements.
String Templating

Template literals (backticks) allow you to embed expressions within strings for easier string formatting and concatenation.

Object Creation and Properties

ES6 offers enhanced object literal syntax for defining properties and methods within objects. This includes shorthand property names, computed property names, and methods directly defined within the object literal.

Iterators and for-of Loops

Iterators provide a way to access elements of data structures one at a time. The for-of loop simplifies iterating through iterables like arrays and strings.
